# Cybersecurity Toolbox 
A node.js visual gui focused toolbox to help cybersecurity blue and red teamers quickly gather knowledge about a target using OSINT and their own in house infrastructure 

In my time as a blue teamer I quickly found myself frutrated by the sheer volume of tools that require either CLI interaction or the like in order to function. Beyond all that, as much as I love my fellow cybersecurity folks, a lot of us suck at GUI elements. So I started building a program in house at my job to help resolve those issues. Now having spent a fair amount of time developing that in house product, I wanted to take what I learned and make a more generalized platofrm for folks to make use of. 

I'll try to develop this platform in my free time as it becomes available
